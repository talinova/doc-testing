<h3 style="text-align: center;">SAVI 3</h3>

<details>

<summary><b>What are the differences between SAVI 2 and SAVI 3?</b>

</summary>

  SAVI version 2 utilizes an underlying EA series Control4 processor, typically running Control4 OS 2.10.6.

  >Note: no versions of SAVI, including SAVI 2, are officially supported on Control4 OS 3.

  SAVI 3 is an independent control system that no longer requires an underlying Control4 controller. SAVI 3 streamlines programming through our new programming tool, Creator, dramatically reduces system configuration time, and makes support fast and efficient. SAVI 3 contains drivers which directly enable integration of supported partner products.
</details>


<details>

<summary><b>How is programming done in SAVI 3?</b>

</summary>

  SAVI 3 utilizes our new browser-based dealer programming tool called SAVI Creator. With Creator running in a modern browser, programmers can use whatever OS and device are preferred – Microsoft Windows, Android, MacOS, iOS (on iPad). No software needs to be downloaded for SAVI system programming, when utilizing Creator.
</details>


<details>

<summary><b>What size systems are supported in SAVI 3?</b>

</summary>

  Dealers can deploy single room systems, stadiums or arenas, and everything in between. As a control and automation system, SAVI scales to fit the needs of virtually any size audio visual project.
</details>

---

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Additional Questions and Answers for Control4 Dealers</h3>

<details>

<summary><b>What do I use for I/O control?</b>

</summary>

  SAVI offers our “Connect I/O” device. The Control4 I/O Extender is not currently supported in SAVI 3.
</details>


<details>

<summary><b>Can I upgrade older SAVI systems to the new SAVI 3?</b>

</summary>

  Yes, if they are current on Annual Support and Maintenance. Prior to any SAVI 2 to SAVI 3 upgrade please consult SAVI Controls for further technical discussion. We may also ask you to send us your Control4/SAVI project files to perform an audit for upgrade feasibility.
</details>


<details>

<summary><b>Does SAVI support Control4 branded products such as audio matrix switches, HDMI switches, etc. in SAVI 3?</b>

</summary>

  In some instances, yes; however, not for all products. The dependency lies in whether or not SAVI can write drivers to directly control 3rd party manufacturer products (Control4 or other). In any such situation SAVI is glad to assess the possibility, and when feasible, we may ask the dealer or customer to send us a test unit for up to 30 days, during which we will write the driver(s) for SAVI integration.
</details>


<details>

<summary><b>Do you integrate with Control4 lighting?</b>

</summary>

  On SAVI 2.X systems, yes. For SAVI 3 systems we integrate with Lutron lighting and may have future announcements about other lighting control systems with which we integrate.
</details>


<details>

<summary><b>What about Control4 remotes, keypads and other interface devices / software – are they compatible with SAVI?</b>

</summary>

  As with SAVI 2, they are not compatible with SAVI 3.
</details>
