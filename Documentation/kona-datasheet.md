# Kona Datasheet

**SAVI Kona** has been cooling AV racks for over a decade. Drawing in air from the front and pushing it out the back, Kona creates a stream of airflow over each component, increasing the reliability and longevity of your hardware by maintaining safe operating temperatures. The pre-mounted fan core on vibration isolators delivers the ultimate quiet cooling experience at only 20dB.

## Key Benefits

* Creates a 20-cfm constant airflow stream over each component
* Maintains safe operating temperatures for equipment and eliminates downtime from overheating
* Saves rack space in a sleek 1RU design with rack ears included
* Pre-mounted fan core on vibration isolators at only 20 dB
