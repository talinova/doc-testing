New to SAVI 3 are Maps. This feature allows uploading an image (such as a floor plan, mock up of a video wall, or a picture) to use as a background to a visual indicator of where devices are located.

The Maps section will display a list of all locations that have been added to the project, as well as a **Full Venue** listing (the Equipment Closet is not included). Any configured location can be selected from the drop-down list in Map View. Finally, any of these maps may be selected as the Default Map to be displayed when activating the view.

#### Maps Properties
1. **Maps:** Lists all locations in the project with the exception of the equipment closet. Also has an entry for Full Venue. Locations with an uploaded map will have a check mark.
2. **Top Bar:** Displays controls for placing items on the map, the Default Map selection, the Save button, and information about the current action.
3. **Edit Field:** Displays the actual map and allows adding, moving, changing, or removing of endpoints.

### Creating Maps
1. Select the location you wish to build and click **Upload Map**.
2. Navigate to and select your desired image. (We recommend using some type of layout, schematic, or other such graphic for ease of recognition)
3. Select **Default Map** to set a location as the default (only one may be set as default).
>***Note: Images must be either BMP, JPEG, or PNG. Resolution and file size are restricted to a maximum of 3840x2160 and 25MB. Images are set to greyscale automatically.***

### Adding Endpoints
1. Click **Place Endpoint** and select a location on the grid to place it. The selected grid anchors the top left of the endpoint.
2. Search for the desired endpoint and select it in the list.
3. Click **Done** in the Top Bar.
