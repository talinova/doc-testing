# SAVI 2 Scene Editor

This specifically details SAVI Scene Editor in versions 3.1 or earlier. Check out the [new and improved Scene Editor](https://kb.savicontrols.com/article/scenes/ "new and improved Scene Editor") if you are using SAVI 3.2.0  or later.

Edit Mode, true to SAVI design, is both robust in features and easy to use. It is separated into three main sections:

1. **Edit Toolbar:** Adds sections to the Edit Menu.
2. **Edit Menu:** Contains editable sections. These are selectable for individual configuration.
3. **Edit Field:** Changes to display sections information. Enabled endpoints will be in color and disabled endpoints will be greyed out with ~~strikethrough~~ text.

To begin, select sections from the Edit Toolbar to add to your Scene. For instance, selecting **Add Display Section** will create a TELEVISIONS section in the Edit Menu.

To add displays to that section, simply select them from the list and they will become active in the Scene. The Section name can also be changed, and volume control can be denied entirely.

There are several sections that can be added with various preset and filter sub-sections. This cutout lists all the options, but there is no limit on how many of each you can add to separate your project into.

##### Edit Menu Properties

* **Section:** This is what separates endpoints into different groups in Facility View. Each type of endpoint (display, audio zone, lighting, etc.,) is grouped together into a section by default.

* **Preset:** These are quick selection options for each individual Section. Every Section starts with two presets by default: All and None.

* **Filter Group:** A collection of Filters. Used for organization.

* **Filter:** Groups any selection of endpoints together for filtering from the Left-Sidebar.

Sections and Filter Groups are great for separating endpoints into large groups such as by floor or building. Filters work well at grouping rooms or areas together. Presets are best utilized for groups of like endpoints that are typically changed together, such as duplicate displays or mirrored audio zones.

>***Each Section, Filter Group, and Filter can be rearranged for convenience.***
