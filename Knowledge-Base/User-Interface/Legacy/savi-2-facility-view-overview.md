# SAVI 2 Facility View Overview

SAVI 2 was the second major iteration of our groundbreaking A/V interface. With the introduction of SAVI 3, we have moved SAVI 2 into legacy software.



In SAVI Facility View, Displays are represented as blue boxes. To control one or more displays, simply select them and the sidebar will show all available sources and controls for that device or group of devices.

#### Controlling Displays
