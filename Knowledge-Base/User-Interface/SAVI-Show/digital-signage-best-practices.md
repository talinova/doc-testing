# Best Practices For Digital Signage

### Resolutions For The 16:9 Aspect Ratio

The most common aspect ratio used for images is generally 16:9 (or 9:16 when portrait orientation). SAVI highly recommends using images that are 1920x1080 resolution at a minimum but higher resolutions will display a more 'crisp' image.

Other common aspect ratios used by SAVI are: 4:1 Slim and 8:1 Slim Wide for ticker style images in L-Shaped layouts, 5:6 Postcard for 2/3rds of portrait layouts, and 1:2 for thin postcards in L-Shaped layouts.

### Recommended Typeface
When including text in digital signage, it should be easily readable by all customers.

* **Sans Serif:** Sans-serif fonts are most prevalent for display of text on computer screens, partly because screens tend to struggle to show fine serif details in small type. Some commonly used Sans-serif typefaces are Arial, Helvetica and Tahoma, but again, there are thousands more.
* **Serif:** Serif fonts are usually used in lengthy text, such as books, newspapers and most magazines. Some common Serif typefaces are Times New Roman, Georgia, Palatino and Garamond.
* **Script (Decorative):** Script fonts are usually decorative in nature and most should be used like one would use a display font, which is to make a statement rather than set text.They are popular with stationery, logotypes, branding, and poster design, and script fonts can be paired with a range of other font styles to create different moods. Popular script fonts include Liesel, Amarone, and Bayamo.


### Font Size Per Distance
Text should always be large enough to easily read on the display. SAVI recommends these minimum font sizes for clear, legible text.

| Distance From Display |  Font Size |
|--------|----------|
| 10 ft  |   20 pt  |
| 15 ft  |   34 pt  |
| 20 ft  |   50 pt  |
| 25 ft  |   66 pt  |
| 35 ft  |  100 pt  |
| 50 ft  |  133 pt  |
| 75 ft  |  200 pt  |

### Display Size And Distance
For optimal clarity, display size should increase with viewing distance to allow content to scale up. SAVI recommends these dimensions at these distances.

| Distance From Display |  Display Size |
|--------|-------|
|  6 ft  |  32"  |
| 10 ft  |  43"  |
| 12 ft  |  48"  |
| 16 ft  |  55"  |
| 18 ft  |  65"  |

### Things To Keep In Mind

* **Don't use more than 2 typefaces.** Multiple styles of text can make your signage look cluttered and disorganized.
* **Use clear, readable text.** Script fonts should only be used sparingly, restrict them to headlines and emphasis. Serif typefaces are usually used for long lines and paragraphs - which should be avoided. Sans Serif typefaces are generally considered best for signage.
* **Establish a hierarchy.** The most important content of an image should be easily discernable at a glance. Use bold and large font sizes for emphasis.
* **Less is more.** The less text there is to read or content contained in an image, the more likely people will see the thing you want them to.
